# Project Overview

## Goal:
The script will:

•	Load a pre-recorded video.

•	Analyze the video and audio sequentially to identify timestamps where a specific face or set of words are detected

•	extract and save the relevant video segments.

## Modules and Their Roles

### OpenCV (cv2):
•	Purpose: To load the video and process frames

•	Functionality: Handles frame-by-frame analysis of the video for face recognition.

### 2.	Face Recognition (face_recognition):
•	Purpose: Detects and identifies specific faces within the video frames captured by OpenCV.

•	Functionality: This library simplifies the face detection and recognition tasks with pre-trained models.

###	3.	Speech Recognition (SpeechRecognition):
•	Purpose: Processes the audio track of the video to detect specific words or phrases.

•	Functionality: Converts audio to text and identifies timestamps of target words.

### 3.	MoviePy (moviepy):
•	Purpose: For handling video processing, such as extracting and saving segments.

•	Functionality: Provides tools for extracting audio from video and saving specific video segments.

## Workflow

### 1.	Video Processing:
•	Use OpenCV to read each frame of the video.

•	Apply face recognition to detect the target face.

•	Record the timestamps where the face is recognized.

### 2.	Audio Processing:
•	Use MoviePy to extract the audio from the video.

•	Use SpeechRecognition to convert the audio to text.

•	Identify and log the timestamps where specific words or phrases are detected.

### 3.	Extract Relevant Segments:
•	Use the timestamps from face and audio detection to pinpoint relevant video segments.
•	Use MoviePy to extract these segments and save them to the specified directory.
